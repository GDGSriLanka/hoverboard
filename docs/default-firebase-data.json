      "description": "Cloud computing has revolutionized the way developers implement and deploy applications. By running applications on large-scale compute infrastructures and programming platforms that are remotely accessible as utility services, cloud computing provides scalability, high-availability, and increased user productivity.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the nuts and bolts of real world cloud platforms. We will talk about the hardware and the data centers that physically make up the cloud, and some of the scheduling and control software that help keep cloud platforms operate continuously at scale. Finally, we will discuss the symbiotic relationship between cloud computing and mobile apps, and look at how platforms like Google Firebase make it easier to develop world-class apps powered by the cloud.",

Also it will be explained how engineering productivity is increased by using  few built-in automations.   There are few features of Gitlab which we in turn use to test Gitlab itself. Also, there are some automations that we did in the Quality team which proved to be so useful that it was incorporated as a feature in Gitlab! This talk will give a glimpse of the \"Inception\" effect of testing and building Gitlab. ",
